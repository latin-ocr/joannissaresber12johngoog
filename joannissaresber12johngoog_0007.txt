PREFACE.

Nexr to his Epistolary writings, the most important
work of our author is his polycraticus, contained in
this and the following volumes. The full title of the
work is Ponronurrcus, stoc de aspis Curiatium et
uestigiis pbilosophorum.

lt appears to be doubtful for what reason tho name
Polycraticws was chosen, for the etymology of that
word gives no indication whatever of the natura or
subject of his work. The treatise is divided into
eight books, to which is prefixed a poetical intro·
duction or prologue entitled Entheticus‚ in which the
author, dedicatinghis work to Becket‚ then Chaucellor
and afterwards Archbishop‚ remarks, that nearly all
mankind were engaged in pursnit of those trifles
against which his work was aimed.

It appears from the Peterborough Chroniole·, that
this work was completed in 1156, though it may have
been written at different times before that date, and

rerised by its author at a later period.

lt has been often printed, after collation with
different MSS. For the present edition the text has
